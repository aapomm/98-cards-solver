# 98 Cards Solver
A program that outputs the best solution for the 98 Cards game using a simple heuristic.

## How to use
Run the `main.rb` script. Input the appropriate values to stdin to mirror your game.

## TODO
1. Implement the Rule of 10 to the heuristic
2. Consider counting cards/statistics when evaluating the minimum difference.
